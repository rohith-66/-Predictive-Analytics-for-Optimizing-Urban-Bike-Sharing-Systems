# -Predictive-Analytics-for-Optimizing-Urban-Bike-Sharing-Systems
Developed a machine learning model to forecast hourly bike rental demand, leveraging historical rental data, weather variables (temperature, humidity, precipitation), and temporal patterns. Utilized Random Forest Regression, XGBoost, and time-series analysis for accurate demand prediction. Processed and analyzed data using Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, and visualized insights with Matplotlib and Seaborn. Integrated seasonality and climatic adjustments to optimize resource allocation and operational efficiency in bike-sharing systems, providing actionable insights for stakeholders.
